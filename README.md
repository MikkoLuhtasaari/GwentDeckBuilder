# GwentDeckBuilder
School project

Gwent is CCG made by CDPR. It’s currently in closed beta state and has around 100 000 active players. Gwent currently has deck builders and trackers for desktop and web but not for mobile devices. CCGs usually have deck builders for all devices so a deck builder for android would be a welcome addition. The app is going to use gwentapi as backend to avoid having to fill out every card information. Unfortunately gwentapi doesn’t yet provide images of cards, so card images have to be added one by one.
